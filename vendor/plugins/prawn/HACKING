= Hacking on Prawn

While we hope to have more extensive documentation for contributors in time, for
now, here is the bare minimum to get you up and running

== NOTES 

Install test-spec, pdf-reader, and mocha from RubyGems

Be sure to load in the necessary git submodules as well:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

If you are running on Ruby 1.9.1, you will need Test::Unit 1.2.3

  gem install test-unit -v 1.2.3
  
== Patch process 

  1. File a ticket in the bug tracker describing a defect or feature

   http://github.com/sandal/prawn/issues

  2. Fork us on Github, make your changes.  Bug fixes or tiny enhancements can
  be done on your master branch, everything else should be done on its own topic
  branch.

  3. Post a comment to the ticket telling us where your fork is, and what
  patches we should be looking at.
  
  If you are working on a ticket that has already been created, skip step 1.
  
  All feature enhancements should come with an example in the examples/ dir,
  and preferably, some specs.
  
  All bug reports should have a reproducible example in bugs/ and preferably,
  some specs.
