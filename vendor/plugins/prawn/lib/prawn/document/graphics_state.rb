      # Pushes the current graphics state on to the graphics state stack so we
      # can restore it when finished with a change we want to isolate (such as
      # modifying the transformation matrix). Used in pairs with
      # restore_graphics_state or passed a block
      #
      # Example without a block:
      #
      #   save_graphics_state
      #   rotate 30
      #   text "rotated text"
      #   restore_graphics_state
      #
      # Example with a block:
      #
      #   save_graphics_state do
      #     rotate 30
      #     text "rotated text"
      #   end
      #
      def save_graphics_state
        add_content "q"
        if block_given?
          yield
          restore_graphics_state
        end
      end

      # Pops the last saved graphics state off the graphics state stack and
      # restores the state to those values
      def restore_graphics_state
        add_content "Q"
      end
    end
  end
