You're looking at the old acts_as_ferret SVN repository.

From 2008/11/25 on, I'll push any further changes to the plugin to the git repositories on Rubyforge and github only. So to get a recent copy of aaf please use one of these:

git://rubyforge.org/actsasferret.git
git://github.com/jkraemer/acts_as_ferret.git

Github also allows downloading of tarballs - check out http://github.com/jkraemer/acts_as_ferret/tree/master .

For bugs and feature requests have a look at http://rm.jkraemer.net/projects/show/aaf
