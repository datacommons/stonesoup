The DCP Coop Directory includes the ability to create custom views of the website which include a custom visual template and pre-defined search filters.

Current implementations include US state-specific views which will use a custom visual theme and restrict directory entries to only entities within the specified state.

FEATURES:
* Activated based on a hostname or set of hostnames (e.g. me.find.coop or maine.find.coop)
* Custom visual template & styling
* The featured "example searches" can be customized
* Enable or Disable the inclusion of "People" in the "Recent Changes" list

DEVELOPMENT:
In order to add a new custom view, the following updates must be made.
Make a short name for your custom view (e.g. "nyc", or "maine").
Say we pick "atlantis".

Add this file:
# app/sites/atlantis_site.rb
See similar files in the same directory for templates.

Add this directory:
# app/views/layouts/atlantis/
See similar directories for examples.

Add a line here:
# config/gmaps_api_key.yml
You need a line for any new hostnames which the website may be served from.

Create a directory
# public/images/atlantis/
Place images as relevant for the new view's visual layout, including a
logo.png to replace the standard one.

If you decide to change CSS, add:
# public/stylesheets/atlantis/
should follow the structure of public/stylesheets/default/
