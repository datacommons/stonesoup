The DCP Coop Directory includes the ability to create custom views of the website which include a custom visual template and pre-defined search filters.

Current implementations include US state-specific views which will use a custom visual theme and restrict directory entries to only entities within the specified state.

FEATURES:
* Activated based on a hostname or set of hostnames (e.g. me.find.coop or maine.find.coop)
* Custom visual template & styling
* The featured "example searches" can be customized
* Enable or Disable the inclusion of "People" in the "Recent Changes" list

DEVELOPMENT:
In order to add a new custom view, the following updates must be made:

# app/controllers/application.rb
-- in #get_site
Add a configuration section for the new view.
-- in #set_custom_filters
Define custom search filters for the new view.

# config/gmaps_api_key.yml
Add a line for any new hostnames which the website may be served from.

# Create app/views/layouts/[viewname].rhtml
where [viewname] is defined by @site_layout in #get_site above
This is the visual template for the new site.

# Create app/views/layouts/summary/[viewname].rhtml 
# Create app/views/layouts/welcome/[viewname].rhtml
These files are used for the main "home" page for the new site.

# Create directory public/images/[viewname] and upload images as relevant for the new view's visual layout.
