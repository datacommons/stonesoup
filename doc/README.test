To run the main test set:
  rake test:functionals

[[If you have multiple versions of ruby, you may (oddly) need to fix
which version rake uses by giving its full path.  Calling "rake" is
different from calling "/usr/bin/rake".]]

To view a test server:
  # Make sure you are not running the development server locally, e.g.:
  #killall ruby
  #killall -9 ruby
  #rm -rf index
  #rm -rf log

  script/ferret_server -e test -R `pwd` start
  script/runner -e test 'Organization.rebuild_index'
  script/server -e test
