<a href="http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~mpavlov/">Marianna Pavlovskaya</a> &lt;mpavlov@hunter.cuny.edu&gt; is a Professor of Geography at the Department of Geography at Hunter College and the PhD program in Earth and Environmental Sciences at CUNY Graduate Center. Currently, she is also an Interim Chair the Geography Department at Hunter College. Her MA degree in geography is from Moscow State University and her PhD in geography from Clark University. Her research fields connect urban, socio-economic, and feminist geography with geospatial technologies. Some of her recent and on-going projects have examined neoliberalization and production of economic difference in post-Soviet Russia; constitution of social body through the U.S. census and geo-spatial data; spatial mobility and gender; and the role of GIS and other geospatial technologies in production of knowledge and enabling progressive social transformations. She was fortunate to work on these and other projects with colleagues in the US, Russia, Norway, and Uganda. She is also fortunate to work with fantastic students at Hunter College and CUNY Graduate Center on their wonderful projects. Her current research theorizes solidarity economy as an instance of economic difference already present within the U.S. economy and aims to constitute it as an object of theory, policy, and action.
